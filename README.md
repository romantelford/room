## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://romantelford.github.io/room/](https://romantelford.github.io/room/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### Continued development

I would create a better slider, the one I created seems very convoluted and repetitive.
